You can ask if you are free to leave more than once during an encounter. If the officer says you are under arrest, you have the right to know why.</p>

                <h2>What to Do If Police Violate Your Rights</h2>
                
                <p>If you are stopped, you can ask the police why they stopped you, but the police are not required to answer that question. You should say out loud, in your clearest voice, so that your goal is to de-escalate the situation, and that you will follow the officer's commands.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>üìπ Document Everything</h4>
                    <p>The safest thing to do is to continue complying with the officer's commands. You should ask the officer if the encounter is being recorded on a bodycam or dashcam. If it is not being recorded, you can ask the officer to turn on their camera. Say out loud the things that you and the police are doing so your narration is recorded on the video.</p>
                </div>

                <p><strong>After the encounter:</strong> Write down or record everything you remember about what happened as soon as possible. It is important to make a record of what happened as soon as you can.</p>
