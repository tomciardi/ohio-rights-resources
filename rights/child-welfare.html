                <h3>üìû Staffing Meeting</h3>
                <p>You will be asked to attend a "staffing meeting" - a phone call with Children and Family Services. They will discuss with you the decisions they are going to make on behalf of your child. <strong>You are entitled to bring support people (family, friends, etc.) to this meeting.</strong> These meetings can be very stressful and overwhelming.</p>

                <div class="note-box">
                    <h4>üè† Where Your Child May Be Placed</h4>
                    <p>Your child may go to live temporarily with:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The child's other parent</strong> (if you are not together)</li>
                        <li><strong>A relative or close family friend</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>A foster home</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Give the social worker information about your family members and close people in your life. <strong>This may help them place your child with someone you know and trust.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <div class="note-box">
                    <h4>üìû Pre-petition Representation</h4>
                    <p>You can seek advice from a lawyer from the very start of your case and when your child is removed, even if you haven't been given an attorney yet. <strong>Call your local Public Defender's office or Legal Aid society for "pre-petition representation".</strong></p>
                </div>

                <div class="note-box">
                    <h4>‚è∞ First Hearing Timeline</h4>
                    <p>Attent the first court hearing. This is sometimes called the <strong>Shelter Care Hearing</strong> and will happen within <strong>24 hours of when your child was removed.</strong> Your social worker will tell you when and where the hearing is going to take place.</p>
                    <p>At the hearing you will be assigned an attorney and can ask them any questions you might have. Before and after court, <strong>your attorney can answer all questions you may have</strong>.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Ask the social worker to set up frequent visits with your child</li>
                    <li>Your social worker will help you have time each week to see your child</li>
                    <li>If appropriate, you may be able to see your child while waiting for your court date</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>üìã Case Plan Requirements</h3>
                <p>If the court finds it's currently unsafe for your child to be at home, you'll need to complete a <strong>Case Plan</strong> before your child can return.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Case Plan will include services you're asked to participate in</li>
                    <li><strong>You are entitled to be part of deciding which services will help you</strong></li>
                    <li>Participating in services helps you get what you need to bring your child home</li>
                    <li>Your social worker will help you get connected to these services</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <h4>ü§ó Remember</h4>
                    <p><strong>Getting help through services does not mean you are a bad parent!</strong> It means you are going the extra mile so that your child can be as safe as possible and have all their needs met.</p>
